# NLP-Project-
In this project, I will build a classifier that can predict how a user feels (positively or negatively) about a given restaurant from their review. This is an example of sentiment analysis: being able to quantify an individual's opinion about a particular topic merely from the words they use.

In this notebook, we'll:

Explore the Yelp review dataset
Preprocess and vectorize our text data for NLP
Train a sentiment analysis classifier with logistic regression
Explore and improve our model
Train a model with word embeddings
